# Unified Fit — Expert Fitting Guidance

## Model structure
The Unified Fit model (Beaucage, 1995/1996) sums structural levels from
smallest to largest scale. Level 1 is the **small-scale** structure;
higher-numbered levels describe progressively larger features. Each level
has a Guinier term (G, Rg) and a power-law term (B, P).

## Level interpretation
Level 1 (highest Q, smallest Rg) represents primary particles or scatterers
in the sample. Higher levels represent larger features. If a higher level's
RgCO is non-zero, it should be linked to the lower level's Rg value; in that
case the two levels together represent one system of scatterers — a fractal
or a particle with two main dimensions (rod, cylinder, disk).

The highest-numbered level commonly represents scattering from features too
large to be fully characterised by the measured data. It typically has only a
power-law slope (G = 0, Rg = 10¹⁰). This may arise from powder grain
particles, scratches on sample surfaces (if the sample is cut and not
polished), large aggregates, voids, precipitates, or any other structure too
large for its Guinier region to fall within the measured Q range.

## Parameter interpretation

**Rg** — radius of gyration in Å. The Guinier knee in the data (where log-log
slope begins to flatten) is roughly at Q ≈ 1/Rg. If the model knee is
displaced from the data knee, Rg is wrong.

**G** — Guinier prefactor. Sets the intensity of this level at Q → 0. If G
is too small, the level contributes negligibly; if too large, it dominates
inappropriately. For a single-level fit, G ≈ I(Q→0).

**P** — power-law exponent (slope in log-log space at high Q for this level).
- P = 4: smooth surface (Porod law)
- 3 < P < 4: rough surface (fractal surface) or size distribution of particles
- P = 3: collapsed polymer globule (poor solvent) or size distribution of particles
- P < 3: mass fractal interior, size distribution of particles, or polymer internal structures

For particle scattering in higher levels that use RgCO: a slope near −1
indicates a rigid rod or cylinder; near −2 indicates a disk; between −1 and
−3 indicates a mass fractal interior. For polymer systems, the P value of
level 1 (smallest features) depends on polymer structure and solvent:
Gaussian coils give a slope around −2, polymer chains in a good solvent give
around −1.67, and other slopes carry their own physical interpretations.

Start with P = 4 fixed; free it only if residuals show a systematic slope
mismatch in the power-law region of the affected level.

**B** — power-law prefactor. Controls the absolute intensity of the power-law
tail. For smooth surfaces (P ≈ 4), B can be linked to G and Rg via the
Porod invariant: B ≈ (1.62/Rg)⁴ × G. Enabling estimate_B automates this.

**RgCO** (RgCutoff) — high-Q exponential roll-off radius. Physically, this is
the lower length-scale limit of the power-law regime — i.e., the primary
particle size when fitting an aggregate. Link RgCO to the next (smaller)
level's Rg when fitting hierarchical structures. Usually at most two levels
are linked together, reflecting primary particles (lower level) and aggregate
size (higher level). Optionally, for particles with two main dimensions, the
lower level represents the smaller dimension (for example, the radius of an
elongated cylinder) and the higher level represents its length. For disk-like
particles the lower level represents thickness (the smaller dimension) and
the higher level represents the disk radius (the larger dimension).

**ETA, PACK** — correlation length and packing factor for the Born-Green
liquid-like ordering correction. Only meaningful for concentrated,
interacting systems. Leave at zero unless there is a clear interference peak.

## Staged fitting strategy
1. Fix everything except background; fit background to correct the baseline
   using high-Q data only, where the flat incoherent background dominates.
2. Free Rg and G for the smallest-features level (lowest level number); keep
   P fixed at 4 and fit to the Q range where the Guinier region of those
   features dominates. Enabling the "Estimate B from G, Rg, P" option reduces
   the number of free parameters and is recommended at this stage.
3. Evaluate residuals. If a systematic slope mismatch remains in the power-law
   region, free P for that level. If needed and physically appropriate, also
   free B.
4. Add a higher-numbered level only if residuals still show systematic
   structure at lower Q values (larger-scale features) than the current levels
   capture. Lower level numbers represent smaller features.
5. When adding a level, start with Rg ~ 5–10× the previous level's Rg
   (hierarchy principle). Free only Rg and G of the new level first.
6. Do not free B and Rg simultaneously without a good starting estimate for
   B; the correlation is strong and the fit may diverge.
7. If a new level is needed between two existing levels, use the Copy/Swap
   Level button to make room while keeping level sizes in the correct order
   (smallest Rg at level 1, increasing with level number).
8. The highest-numbered level (largest features) may have only a power-law
   slope because its Guinier region falls outside the measured Q range (below
   the minimum Q). In this case set G = 0 and Rg = 10¹⁰ for that level,
   leaving only the power-law slope. This is normal when the data show a
   low-Q power-law slope without an obvious Guinier knee.

## Residual pattern recognition
- **Horizontal band around zero, random scatter** → good fit.
- **S-shaped (negative then positive with increasing Q)** → Rg is too large;
  reduce Rg or tighten its upper bound.
- **Inverted S-shape (positive then negative)** → Rg is too small.
- **Monotone slope in residuals** → P is wrong; free P.
- **Bump or dip near a specific Q** → a structural feature at that scale is
  not modelled; consider adding a level or enabling correlations.
- **Systematic bump over a broader Q range** → a missing level representing
  scatterers at that size scale.
- **High residuals only at very low Q** → beam-stop artifact or missing
  large-scale level; restrict Q range or add a Guinier level for the
  large-scale structure.
- **High residuals only at very high Q** → background is too low or there is
  an incoherent baseline; increase background or restrict Q range.
- **High-frequency noise on residuals** → uncertainty estimates for the
  measured data are too small, or the data contain features the Unified Fit
  model cannot describe (diffraction peaks or other sharp features). Data
  uncertainties are commonly under- or over-estimated.
- **χ²** → The acceptable range varies widely due to common under- or
  over-estimation of data uncertainties. Do not focus on the absolute value of
  χ²; look instead for the absence of systematic low-frequency variations as
  the indicator of a good fit. A fit with χ² = 10 can be as good as one with
  χ² = 0.1 if the model represents the data well and the residuals show only
  higher-frequency noise than the Guinier and Porod approximations can capture.

## Common mistakes
- **Fitting with too many free parameters at once** — parameters are strongly
  correlated. Always use staged fitting; freeing everything simultaneously
  rarely converges to a physically meaningful solution.
- **Rg of one level near Rg of another** — levels overlap in Q space and
  compete; the fit is degenerate. Ensure Rg values are separated by at least
  a factor of 3.
- **B too small or zero for a free-P level** — B and P are correlated; if B
  is near its lower bound, P will drift to compensate. Reset B to a
  physically reasonable value and refit.
- **G of a level fixed at zero** — that level contributes no Guinier term and
  is effectively a power-law-only level, which is physically unusual. Only
  do this intentionally for the highest-numbered level when its Guinier
  region is outside the measured Q range (see step 8 in Staged fitting).

## Q-range advice
Always check whether the full Q range is appropriate before fitting:
- Exclude low-Q points dominated by beam-stop shadow (they drive the
  background up artificially).
- Exclude high-Q points where the signal-to-noise ratio is poor
  (they pull P to unphysical values).
- State explicitly if you are advising the user to change the Q range.

## Reporting
When the fit converges, report: Rg and G for each level, P and whether it
is consistent with the expected morphology, reduced χ², and any caveats
about parameter correlations or parameters hitting their bounds.
